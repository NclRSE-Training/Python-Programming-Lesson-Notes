## 7.3 Thatâ€™s Not Not What I Meant

Sometimes it is useful to check whether some condition is not true. The Boolean operator ```not``` can do this explicitly. After reading and running the code below, write some ```if``` statements that use ```not``` to test the rule that you formulated in the previous challenge.

```python
if not '':
    print('empty string is not true')
if not 'word':
    print('word is not true')
if not not True:
    print('not not True is true')

```
