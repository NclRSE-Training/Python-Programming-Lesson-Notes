## Episode 2 Exercise 6


Many Ways of Access

There are at least two ways of accessing a value or slice of a DataFrame: by name or index. However, there are many others. For example, a single column or row can be accessed either as a ```DataFrame``` or a ```Series``` object.

Suggest different ways of doing the following operations on a DataFrame:

1. Access a single column
1. Access a single row
1. Access an individual DataFrame element
1. Access several columns
1. Access several rows
1. Access a subset of specific rows and columns
1. Access a subset of row and column ranges
