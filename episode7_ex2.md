## 7.2 What Is Truth?

```True``` and ```False``` booleans are not the only values in Python that are true and false. In fact, any value can be used in an ```if``` or ```elif```. After reading and running the code below, explain what the rule is for which values are considered true and which are considered false.


```python
if '':
    print('empty string is true')
if 'word':
    print('word is true')
if []:
    print('empty list is true')
if [1, 2, 3]:
    print('non-empty list is true')
if 0:
    print('zero is true')
if 1:
    print('one is true')

```
