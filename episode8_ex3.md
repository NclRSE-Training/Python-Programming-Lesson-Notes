## 8.3 Selecting Characters From Strings

If the variable ```s``` refers to a string, then ```s[0]``` is the stringâ€™s first character and ```s[-1]``` is its last. Write a function called ```outer``` that returns a string made up of just the first and last characters of its input. A call to your function should look like this:

```python
print(outer('helium'))
```

```console
hm
```
